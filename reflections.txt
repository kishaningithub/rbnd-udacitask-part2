# REFLECTIONS

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
   1) Delete by item type deletes multiple elements at once. This 
      allowed be to have a confusion whether to user ! in the end 
      of the method name or not as described in the above links
      i have chosen not to.
   2) Change the priority levels of items. Seemed intresting to reuse existing
      errors(IndexExceedsListSize, InvalidPriorityValue) and reusing methods (validate_priority)
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
   1) Yes. Find intresting gems and use it for fun projects.
